### üëã Hello, I'm Veronika!

I am a full-stack Software Engineer currently based in Greater Hartford, Connecticut, with experience that includes JavaScript/Node.js, TypeScript, Golang, Python, Ruby, PostgreSQL, React, Express, and AWS. My most recent accomplishment is [MIMIC](https://mimic-replay.github.io), an open-source, error-focused session replay framework streamlining the recording and replaying of user sessions. 

My background as a neurological physical therapist cultivated a passion for complex problem solving within collaborative environments‚Äîa skill that has significantly deepened in my software engineering career. I am actively seeking my next opportunity to tackle new challenges, contribute to innovative projects, and further my technical development.
